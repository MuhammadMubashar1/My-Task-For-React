# My-Task-For-React

Create a react counter app.
1. The counter starts from zero and the user can see the number on the screen.
2. Create 2 Buttons, One for Increment and one for Decrement.
3. Users can also change the number by clicking on the text field and entering their desired number.
4. If the number reaches 0, then the Decrement button should get disabled.
5. If the current number is the prime number then the color of the text changes.
